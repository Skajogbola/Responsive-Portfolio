            “Simi”. I am based out of the city of brotherly love “Philly”. I was born and raised into a family of 3 in
            the western part of Africa “Nigeria”. I am happily married and a graduate of petroleum Engineering from the
            University of Louisiana at Lafayette. Over the past years, I have been opportune to gain some work
